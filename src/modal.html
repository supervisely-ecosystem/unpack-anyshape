  <b>Brief overview:</b>
  <ul>
    <li> Result project name = original name + "(rasterized)" suffix </li>
    <li>Classes with shapes "rectangle", "polygon", "bitmap" and "any shape" will be converted to shape bitmap, other classes will remain the same</li>
    <li>All objects will be rasterized without intersections (i.e. one pixel will belong to only one object)</li>
    <li>Classes with other shapes ("polyline", "point", etc) and their objects will be copied to result project without modification</li>
  </ul>
