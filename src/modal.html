    <b>Brief overview:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Result project name = original name + "(without AnyShape)" suffix</li>
        <li>Your data is safe: app creates new project with modified classes and objects. The original project will
            remain unchanged
        </li>
        <li>All "AnyShape" classes will be unpacked to equivalent classes with strictly defined shapes. For examples: if
            you have class "Person" (AnyShape) and you labeled objects with both polygonal and brush tools, this class
            will be unpacked to two classes: "Person_polygon" and "Person_bitmap"
        </li>
        <li>Colors of new classes will be generated randomly</li>
        <li>Optional: be default app removes original class, because all objects will be duplicated and associated
            with new corresponding classes
        </li>

    </ul>
