    <b>Overview:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Result project name = original name + "(without AnyShape)" suffix</li>
        <li>Your data is safe: app creates new project with modified classes and objects. The original project
            remains unchanged
        </li>
        <li>All "AnyShape" classes will be unpacked to equivalent classes with strictly defined shapes. For examples: if
            you have class "Person" (AnyShape) and you labeled objects with both polygonal and brush tools, this class
            will be unpacked to two classes: "Person_polygon" and "Person_bitmap"
        </li>
        <li>Colors of new classes will be generated randomly</li>
    </ul>
